Alfingo Questionnaire
==========================

Based on surveylib(https://github.com/AndreiD/surveylib), but with enough changes that I thought it warranted a repository of its own.

## A simple to use, survey library for collecting feedback from your users.


### Instalation:

The old fashioned way still, clone and use. I'll try and get it on maven someday.

### How to use it:

I'm still documenting how to use everything the library has to offer.
